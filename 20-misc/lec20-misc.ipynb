    "  * Chisel is a Scala library, and we treat it like an _embedded domain-specific language_\n",
    "* While executing, any Chisel object referenced/constructed is instantiated\n",
    "  * Includes even a literal (e.g. `4.U`) or a slight tweak (e.g. `~io.in`)\n",
    "  * Every object has _inputs_ and/or _outputs_\n",
    "  * Under the hood, those objects are tracked (e.g. inside `extends Module`)\n",
    "* Chisel connections (`:=` and `<>`) induce side-effects on the Chisel objects\n",
    "  * Changes inputs by connecting them to outputs\n",
    "* _Summary:_ think of your Chisel design as a Scala program that _instantiates_ Chisel things and _connects_ them\n",
    "  * Much of the parameterizability/flexibility is coming from the Scala program\n",
    "* Your goal is to properly connect things to the inputs/outputs of modules\n",
    "  * Tools will prune components that are unreachable from an input or output"
